# water-level-detector
Water level detector is designed for water detection, which can be widely used in sensing rainfall, water level, and even liquid leakage.



Connecting a water sensor to an Arduino is a great way to detect a leak, spill, flood, rain, etc. It can be used to detect the presence, the level, the volume and/or the absence of water. While this could be used to remind you to water your plants, there is a better Grove sensor for that. The sensor has an array of exposed traces, which read LOW when water is detected.
