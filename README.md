# water-level-detector
Water level detector is designed for water detection, which can be widely used in sensing rainfall, water level, and even liquid leakage.



Connecting a water sensor to an Arduino is a great way to detect a leak, spill, flood, rain, etc. It can be used to detect the presence, the level, the volume and/or the absence of water. While this could be used to remind you to water your plants, there is a better Grove sensor for that. The sensor has an array of exposed traces, which read LOW when water is detected.


Components Required:-

1) Arduino:-

Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.

The Arduino platform has become quite popular with people just starting out with electronics, and for good reason. Unlike most previous programmable circuit boards, the Arduino does not need a separate piece of hardware (called a programmer) in order to load new code onto the board -- you can simply use a USB cable. Additionally, the Arduino IDE uses a simplified version of C++, making it easier to learn to program. Finally, Arduino provides a standard form factor that breaks out the functions of the micro-controller into a more accessible package.

If you have ever had a water heater explode or ever tried to make submersible electronics, then you know how important it is to detect when water is around.

With this Water Level Sensor, you can do just that!

This sensor can be used to measure the water level, monitor a sump pit, detect rainfall or detect leakage.
